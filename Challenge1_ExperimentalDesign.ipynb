    "### The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.   \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problem could be the delivery or the person who delivers it.    \n",
    "Emperor Palpatine may be more convincing than Darth Vader.    \n",
    "Darth Vader doesn't seem like someone who will work well with others could be a possible reason why so few of Droids that listend to Darth Vader converted to the Dark side.   \n",
    "Maybe if Darth Vader delivered the \"Anger\" slogan, he will have recruited all if not more Droids since he has given into anger and can deliver a believable message there.       \n",
    "\n",
    "One resolution could be to have Emperor Palpatine deliver both Slogans. \n",
    "Or Darth Vader deliver both Slogans to different Droids and see who is able to convert the most Droids to the Dark Side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best thing to do is to the divide the Droids in groups of 25.    \n",
    "Have Darth Vader Deliver Both Slogans to 2 of the 25 Droids groups.   \n",
    "Have Emperor Palpatine deliver Both slogans to the remaining 2 of the 25 groups.    \n",

    "### In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.     \n",

    "The problem here is that it seems that Jar Jar Binks seems to have been sent to Four Friendly planet while Mace was sent to four Unfriendly planet.     \n",
